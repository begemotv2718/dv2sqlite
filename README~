SHORT DESCRIPTION

Store information on individual frames of dv files in the 
sqlite database. Also stores sha1 sums of the frames, 
allowing to search for duplicates. Based on dv2sub code. 

LONG DESCRIPTION

When using DV camera, it may be tempting to use single cassete
multiple times, dumping the contents of the cassete to the hard 
disk each time after using the camera. However, this create 
DV files that contain old frames. Also, it is possible to create
multiple DV files with basically the same frame content during editing 
of the file. Thus, it is practical to have a tool that will maintain the
database of all the frames stored on the hard disk, allowing to search 
for particular frame, search for duplicates, and to access all the frame 
metainformation quickly. 

My tool stores metainformation on all the frames in the SQLITE database.
